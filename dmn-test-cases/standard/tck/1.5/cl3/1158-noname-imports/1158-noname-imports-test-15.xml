    <!--
    Model A has decision001 and decision003.  Model B has decision002 and also decision003.

    Decision001 requires decision002 (in model B).  In model B, decision002 requires
    decision003 BUT uses an fully qualified href (not just a local one) .

    Decision003 already exists in model A, so, despite the fully qualified href we expect the
    decision003 requirement in model B to be resolved to the decision in model A
    -->

    <testCase id="001">
        <description>fully qualified local requirement href of imported decision will be resolved locally when there is a name conflict</description>
        <resultNode name="decision001" type="decision">
